## Usage

To execute the solver, execute `python main.py <input> <output>`. `input` and `output` are file names to the input and output json file respectively.

For more information about hyper-parameters, `python main.py -h`.

## Arrows

To decode arrow direction, convert integer back to binary. For instance `1` converts to `0001` which is a **right arrow**. A 1 in each position represents UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT respectively.
